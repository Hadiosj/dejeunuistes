# Modal Components

All modal dialog components used throughout the app.

## Files

- **SearchModal.jsx** - Modal for searching restaurants using Google Places API
- **PreviewModal.jsx** - Preview modal showing restaurant info before adding to database
- **AddRestaurantModal.jsx** - Form modal to add a new restaurant with initial rating
- **RatingModal.jsx** - Modal to add a new rating to an existing restaurant

All modals use the NES.css framework for retro pixel-art styling and handle their own form state, passing actions back via callback props.
